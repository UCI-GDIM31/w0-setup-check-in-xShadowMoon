# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1.
Hello, my name is Yihan Wang, but I go by Cary. My pronouns are he/his. I play quite a lot of games and there are a lot of different genres that I like such as First Person Shooters and Soulslike. The games that I like to play are Minecraft, Black Myth Wukong and Elden Ring, but there are a lot more that I like. I am taking the class because I really like playing games and would like to learn how to make a game and want to get into the game design industry. I don't have any experience in this part yet and I am just starting it now. The kind of games that I hope to build is that most people could enjoy playing it.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  
I am currently a Philosophy major but I am working onto transferring to GDIM.

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
Just like the class name intro of programming games, so I am hoping to learn some coding about games and how to make some easy games.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
I don't think I am nervous about this class, I feel like I am very confident in this class since it could be a class that I would enjoy taking.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

3. Unity
I taken a intro to game design class before in college where it teach some unity but right now I already forgot how it works so probably 0 knowledge for Unity as well.
